# Toggle the floating nav bar on the AWS website and blog

## AWS
[The AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com) has a floating navigation bar on a lot of pages which, when viewing on a small screen takes up way too much screen real estate. 
example: [Training and Certification](https://aws.amazon.com/training/?nc2=h_rsc_lrn_tc)
example: [Blog Post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/building-an-ai-gateway-to-amazon-bedrock-with-amazon-api-gateway/)

## And...
...it is infuriating! It's too big and takes up too much screen, especially on smaller laptops and mobile/tablet devices when reading blog posts.

## Installation
You will need [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) installed. Use the [raw version](https://github.com/deanlj/https://github.com/deanlj/Toggle-AWS-Floating-NavBar/raw/refs/heads/main/toggle-aws-floatig-navbar.user.js) to trigger Tampermonkey automatically detecting the script.
